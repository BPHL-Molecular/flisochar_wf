# flisochar_wf
A New web-deployed workflow of FLISOCHAR that supports both ONT and PacBio long reads

[FLISOCHAR](https://github.com/BPHL-Molecular/flisochar) is a Florida BPHL Pipeline to genomically characterize bacterial isolates using a hybrid assembly method.


# Introduction

Flisochar owes its inspiration to FLAQ-AMR, the Florida BPHL's standard pipeline for taxonomic characterization and AMR detection.

The Flisochar's overaching goal is to improve the identification of bactorial isolates using hybrid assembly from short and long-read sequencing data. Short-read and long-read sequences can be respectively from the Illumina MiSeq system and the Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
The pipeline is built in Nextflow, and Python is used to develop custom scripts, enabling the parse of output. It comes with singularity container to simplify installation.

# Workflow

The current worflow comprises:
1) Quality Control
2) De novo genome assembly
3) Species Identification
4) Genome Annotation
5) Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
6) Genomic Comparison

# Software Tools implemented
1. Quality control on reads: fastp, [longqc](https://github.com/yfukasawa/LongQC)
2. Three genome assemblers: canu, dragonflye, unicycler (run only canu and unicycler with pacbio long reads)
3. Taxonomic classification progams: [Kaiju](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju). This version only emplements Kraken and Mash.
4. Genome annotators: bakta, pgap, prokka (bakta is omitted in this version)
5. Antimicrobial resistance genes marker: AMRFinderPlus
6. Average nucleotide identity (ANI): pyANI(pgap)

# Installation
At the moment, it is meant to clone this repository to your local directory.[Clone a directory](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## Software Requirements
Flisochar requires Python (version 3.6 or higher with the package Pandas installed), Nextlow, Singularity (apptainer) available in your system.

### Pgap

Currenly, the installation of [pgap](https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki/Quick-Start) is also required. Before installing, we recommend to create a directory path for the installation under your group
```
mkdir /*/YourGroup/UserName/repos/ncbi/pgap
```
and cd to it. Set this environment variable <PGAP_INPUT_DIR> to the created path,
```
export PGAP_INPUT_DIR=/*/YourGroup/UserName/repos/ncbi/pgap/
```
simply to save everything on your HPC cluster. Note the slash at the end of the previous path(../pgap/) is required, so that all pgap's files are found in that directory. Download the pgap.py file as directed. Change the file into executable mode (chmod +x pgap.py). Then execute the command below on your terminal, and pagap installation will be complete.
```
./pgap.py --update -D apptainer
```

# Resource Requirements

Before running flisochar, ensure that required computing resources are available.
Cores: 28, Memory: 200gb, Time ~ 2:00 hrs for one hybrid (short-read, long-read) bacterial sample

# Running Flisochar

Once the pipeline is available on your system (or on HiPerGator), get an interactive run by following these first steps:
```
export PGAP_INPUT_DIR=/*/YourGroup/UserName/repos/ncbi/pgap/
```

```
module load nextflow apptainer
```
The above two commands and resources may also be written in a job scheduler (sbatch or slurm script) instead.

## General Usage

```
nextflow run flisochar_wf.nf --lr_type <pcb or ont> --lreads '*.fastq.gz' --sreads '*_{1,2}.fastq.gz' --asb_tool <canu or unicycler or dragonflye > --genomeSize <numberm or numberM> --outdir 'output path'

```
The full usage may be accessed by executing the following command:

```
nextflow flisochar_wf.nf --help
```

### Example
Run the pipeline on the test dataset in your working directory using the following command:

```
nextflow run flisochar_wf.nf --lr_type pcb --lreads 'LRdata/*.fastq.gz' --sreads 'SRdata/*_{1,2}.fastq.gz' --asb_tool canu --genomeSize 3.5m --outdir flisochar_test01
```
### Maxikraken2 Database
The flisochar_wf.nf worflow supports the maxikraken2 dabase if you want use it to maximize Kraken percentages. However, users outside of the cluster HPG need to download maxikraken2 database from [here](https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html). You will provide the path(where you downloaded the DB) and the name within the path (--kradb "/YOUR_PATH/kraken_databases"  --krdbName "maxikraken2_1903_140GB" ) when use the maxikraken2 database.

### Flisochar_wf Ouput
Flisochar_wf ouputs seven directories refecting the worklow's features.
(1) amrfinder  (2) ani_out  (3) annotation  (4) assemblies  (5) quality_control  (6) quast_out  (7) species-identification
